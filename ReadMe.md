# About Me:
I'm currently working on expanding my knowledge of Go and applying it to personal projects, focusing on building efficient and scalable applications. My name is Kharon, and I'm passionate about crafting well-designed solutions.<br>‚Ä¢  I'm looking to collaborate on open-source Go projects, particularly those related to backend development, cloud infrastructure, or distributed systems. I'm eager to learn from experienced developers and contribute my skills.<br>‚Ä¢  I'm looking for help with understanding advanced Go concepts, such as concurrency patterns, memory management, and optimizing performance.<br>‚Ä¢  I'm currently learning about gRPC, Kubernetes, and other technologies commonly used in Go-based microservices architectures.<br>‚Ä¢  Ask me about my journey learning Go, my favorite Go libraries, or my experience with different development workflows. I'm always happy to share what I've learned.<br>‚Ä¢  Fun fact: I once wrote a Go program that automatically generates haikus! It's a fun way to explore the language's capabilities. I'm Kharon, by the way!
